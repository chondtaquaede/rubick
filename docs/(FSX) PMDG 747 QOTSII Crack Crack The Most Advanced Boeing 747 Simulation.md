- A realistic sound package that captures every nuance of the 747 engines, cockpit sounds, environmental sounds, and cabin announcements. You will hear the roar of the engines spooling up and down, the clunk of the landing gear retracting and extending, the click of the switches and buttons, the chime of the seat belt sign, the voice of the captain and crew, and many other sounds that will enhance your immersion.
- A comprehensive flight model that simulates the aerodynamics, performance, and handling characteristics of the 747-400 and 747-8 variants. You will feel the difference in weight, thrust, drag, lift, fuel consumption, speed, altitude, range, and maneuverability between the different models and configurations. You will also experience realistic effects such as wind gusts, turbulence, ground friction, engine failures, stalls, spins, and more.
- A wide selection of liveries that represent real-world airlines and operators that use or have used the 747-400 and 747-8 models. You can choose from over 100 liveries that cover different regions and eras of aviation history. You can also create your own custom liveries using the included paint kit.
- An advanced weather radar that displays precipitation intensity and type, storm cells, turbulence zones, windshear alerts, and terrain avoidance warnings. You can use the weather radar to plan your route around adverse weather conditions and avoid potential hazards.
- An electronic flight bag (EFB) that provides useful information and tools for your flight planning and execution. You can use the EFB to access charts, maps, performance calculations, checklists, manuals, documents, fuel loading options,
