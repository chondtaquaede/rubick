Kartilya Ng Katipunan is a document that contains the teachings and principles of the Katipunan, a secret society that fought for Philippine independence from Spanish colonial rule in the late 19th century. The document was written by Emilio Jacinto, one of the leaders and intellectuals of the Katipunan, who was also known as the "utak ng Katipunan" or the "brain of the Katipunan".
 
The Kartilya Ng Katipunan was first mentioned in the minutes of a supreme assembly meeting of the Katipunan in December 1895. It consists of 13 rules or precepts that guide the members of the society on how to live a moral and patriotic life. Some of the rules include love of God, country, and fellowmen; respect for human rights and dignity; honesty and integrity; courage and self-reliance; and generosity and compassion. The document also contains a pledge of allegiance to the Katipunan and its cause.

The Kartilya Ng Katipunan is considered as one of the most important historical sources of the Philippine revolution. It reflects the ideals and aspirations of the Katipuneros, who were willing to sacrifice their lives for freedom and justice. It also serves as a moral beacon for self-transformation and good governance for the contemporary times.

Emilio Jacinto was not only a fighter, but also a thinker and a writer. He authored several essays and poems that expressed his patriotic and revolutionary ideals. Some of his notable works include A La Patria (To the Fatherland), Gising na, Bayan! (Awaken, Nation!), and Pahayag (Declaration). He also wrote the lyrics of the Katipunan hymn, Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan (Noble Hymn of the Tagalogs), which was set to music by Julio Nakpil.
 
Emilio Jacinto died on April 16, 1899, at the age of 23. He succumbed to malaria in Majayjay, Laguna, where he was hiding from the Spanish forces. His remains were later transferred to Manila and buried at the Manila North Cemetery. He was honored as one of the national heroes of the Philippines for his role in the Philippine Revolution.
 
Emilio Jacinto's legacy lives on in his writings and deeds. His Kartilya Ng Katipunan is still considered as a source of inspiration and guidance for Filipinos who aspire for a free and just society. His life and martyrdom are also commemorated in various monuments, streets, schools, and organizations that bear his name.
